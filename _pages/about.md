I am an AI resident at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) Menlo Park, working in Reinforcement Learning under [Mohammad Ghavamzadeh](https://chercheurs.lille.inria.fr/~ghavamza/my_website/About_Me.html). Previously I was at IIT Madras, where I was advised by Prof. [Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).
