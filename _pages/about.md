I am a final year PhD student at the University of Alberta, working in Reinforcement Learning. I am fortunate to be advised by [Matthew E. Taylor](https://drmatttaylor.net/) at the UofA. During my PhD, I have spent considerable time at MSR Montreal and New York, where I worked with [Philip Bachman](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/phbachma/), [Alex Lamb](https://sites.google.com/view/alexmlamb/home) and [John Langford](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jcl/). I also spent a year as a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley, where I was advised by [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/).

Previously, I was an AI resident at Facebook AI Research, Menlo Park, where I got the chance to work with [Mohammad Ghavamzadeh](https://mohammadghavamzadeh.github.io/). Even before, I was an undergraduate at IIT Madras, where I got introduced to RL research by [Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).

Currently, I am working on efficient tokenization schemes for video prediction models, and on developing planning capabilities in language models.

**I am on the industry job market currently. Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit for any relevant research roles!**
