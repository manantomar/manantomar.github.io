I am a second year PhD student at the University of Alberta, working in Reinforcement Learning. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Matthew E. Taylor](https://drmatttaylor.net/) at the UofA. I also spend my time at MSR Montreal, where I work with [Philip Bachman](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/phbachma/).


Previously, I was an AI resident at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) Menlo Park, where I got the chance to work with [Dr. Mohammad Ghavamzadeh](https://mohammadghavamzadeh.github.io/). Even before, I was an undergraduate at IIT Madras, where I got introduced to RL research by Prof. [Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).

Currently, I am working on learning efficient representations, particularly for offline video datasets. I am also interested in combining backprop with local update mechanisms for training large neural networks.
